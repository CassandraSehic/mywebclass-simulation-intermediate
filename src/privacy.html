                        collects information such as how often users visit the site, what pages they visit when they do

                        cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website.
                        This cookie cannot be used by anyone other than Google. Googleâ€™s ability to use and share
                        information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our website is restricted by the
                        Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.</p>

                        it was collected, unless a longer retention period is required by law. We take reasonable
                        measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized
                        access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
